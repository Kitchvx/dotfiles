# Dotfiles

Dotfiles for my [Arch](https://archlinux.org) install on my Thinkpad T480

Very, very.. basic. Since this is my first time getting hands on with the inner workings of linux don't expect anything amazing!

## Clone & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kitchvx/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/
```
Make sure to run:
```bash
sudo chown USER:USER .dotfiles/
```

```bash
./install.sh
```
